Meeting Minutes Tool!

Prompt:

I love the Meeting Minutes tool in CMIC and Procore because it lets me have an agenda with items which carry forward to the next meeting until they're closed. I like how, otherwise, each set of meeting minutes is otherwise self-contained.
 
 I don't want a single file for each meeting and follow-up meeting. I want a tool that will let me finish a meeting, with a "create next meeting" button that carries forward all previous open items, maintaining their order and structure, to the next meeting. It should then have a spot to add new notes, identified by the date added, and show all dated previous notes about the same agenda item.
 
 Meta data should include meeting topic, date, time, physical location, teams meeting link, and a list of attendees (both recurring and one-off).
 
 All of these features are critical.
 
 You are a professional Python / Windows programmer with 20 years of experience developing, planning, testing, and deploying custom scripted solutions.
 
 Write me this software as a stand-alone program. Use Python. It should have a typical Windows GUI.
 
 Main screen of the application should have a list of meeting tracks. Some meetings are one-off, others are recurring. They can be intermingled. I should be able to sort the list by most recent meeting date, upcoming meeting dates, or alphabetical.
 
 I should then be able to add different sections and agenda items. Agenda items should include the description, status (open, closed, or INFO). I'll be including action items. I'll be adding minutes for each item, first with the date of the meeting followed by the minute.
 
 Once the meeting has taken place, I should then be able to select a "create next meeting" option somewhere. That creates the next meeting file in the same folder. The new file should carry forward everything in the header, and carry forward all agenda items where the status is not "closed". 
 
 Before you start programming, I want you to ask me all of the clarification questions you can think of. Also provide based practices. EG I want to track who is SUPPOSED to be at the meeting, but also who actually ATTENDED the meeting.
